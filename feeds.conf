https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php?download=ipblocklist				ZEUS	malware	https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/	Abuse.ch	Standard, contains the same data as the ZeuS IP blocklist (zeus_badips)  but with the slight difference that it do not exclude hijacked websites (level 2)  and free web hosting providers (level 3) . This means that this blocklist contains all IPv4 addresses associated with ZeuS C&amp;Cs which are currently being tracked by ZeuS Tracker. Hence this blocklist will likely cause some false positives.
https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php?download=badips					ZEUS_BADIPS	malware	https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/	Abuse.ch	Badips includes IPv4 addresses that are used by the ZeuS trojan. It is the recommened blocklist if you want to block only ZeuS IPs. It excludes IP addresses that ZeuS Tracker believes to be hijacked (level 2)  or belong to a free web hosting provider (level 3) . Hence the false postive rate should be much lower compared to the standard ZeuS IP blocklist.
